* .dotfiles
- Just my dotfiles with my personal preference on setting up GNU/Guix with all the apps set up to my taste
- Just copied stuff from here and there

* Requirements
- Alacritty
- git
- Neovim
- i3 (Tiling Windows Manager)
- QuteBrowser
- tmux
- VIM
- zathura
- zathura-pdf-mupdf
- zsh (shell)

* Terminal Driven Workflow
- I am primarily using Emacs as my daily driver for all of my development, notetaking and various other tasks
- Was earlier using VIM and/ Neovim on Tmux multiplexer as main development environment
  - VIM and Neovim are no more maintained

* Quick Start
#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:riz-ahmed/.dotfiles.git ./
#+end_src

* Create symlinks
- I am using stow to manage dotfiles locally
  #+begin_src shell
    stow .                          # after cloning the repo
  #+end_src

* Emacs packages
- Emacs packages needs to be installed manually using =M-x: install-packages=
