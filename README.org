* .dotfiles
- Just my dotfiles with my personal preference on setting up Arch Linux with all the apps set up to my taste
- There is nothing special about this, just copied stuff from here and there
  
* Installs
- I am primarily using Emacs as my daily driver for all of my development, notetaking and various other tasks
- Was earlier using VIM and/ Neovim on Tmux multiplexer as main development environment
  
* Quick Start
#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:riz-ahmed/.dotfiles.git ./
#+end_src
