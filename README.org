* .dotfiles
- Just my dotfiles with my personal preference on setting up Arch Linux with all the apps set up to my taste
- Copied stuff from here and there

* Requirements
- Emacs (29 or higher)
- Alacritty
- git
- i3 (Tiling Windows Manager)
- QuteBrowser
- tmux
- VIM
- zathura
- zathura-pdf-mupdf
- zsh (shell)

* Terminal Driven Workflow
- I use Emacs as my main text editor for all of my development, notetaking and managing git repos
- Vim is just used for emergency editing and doesn't really have all those cool features

* Quick Start
#+begin_src shell
  git clone git@github.com:riz-ahmed/.dotfiles.git ./
#+end_src

* Create symlinks
- I am using stow to manage my dotfiles locally =stow .=

* Start kmonad service
- Copy =kmonad.service= from .config/kmonad to =/usr/lib/systemd/system=
- Enable it as a systemd service
#+begin_src shell
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl enable --now kmonad.service
#+end_src
